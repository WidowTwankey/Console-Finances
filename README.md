## Calculating a company's profits/losses


- Motivation: To provide a company with a financial overview of their profits/losses from Jan 2010 to Feb 2017.
- Why I built this: To learn and show how I can use Javascript for such purposes as above.
- Problem solved: The company's profits and such are clearly displayed in the console.
- I learned: How to use Javascript for calculations and handling large amounts of data that would take too much time to calculate by hand.
